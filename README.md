This repository contains the frontend code for the Leetray project, a web application for dental analysis. It is built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later) and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (the port may vary) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run preview`

Runs the production build locally. This is a good way to check if the production version of your app is working correctly before deploying.

### `npm run check`

Runs the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors in the codebase without generating any output files.
